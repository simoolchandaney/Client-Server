## Usage
- make (ran in ComputerNetworksProject01 directory): creates ./client/proj1client and ./server/proj1server executables
- ./project1client IP/hostname port file (ran under client subdirectory)
- ./proj1server port (ran under server subdirectory)
- make clean: removes executables 
        
  port has to be within 41000-41999 range and has to be the same for both commands

## Extra Credit
- [X] Support the usage of a host name in addition to an IP address for the first argument of the client
- [X] Allow connections to arrive only from the 129.74.* address range, localhost (127.*), or the private network (192.168.*)
